This app is deliberately not using any kind of databases (either for plain text-data, or images, etc).
Its purpose is to use vanilla Javascript to interact between HTML & CSS.

If you want to set your own PORT, you can edit the 'config/.env' file accordingly.
You will also have to manually edit the 'public/js/main.js' file's 'baseUrl' variable, sitting at the very top.
