# Vanilla Javascript Dota Heroes app

## This app let's you filter through various Dota heroes' properties and individually show their info

This app is deliberately not using any kind of databases or libraries (either for plain text-data, or images, etc). Its purpose is to use vanilla Javascript to interact between HTML & CSS.

All you have to do is clone the repository into your computer, enter the corresponding directory and run **_npm install_**. After that, you just run **_node server.js_** and you are ready to go!

If you want to set your own PORT, you can edit the **_'config/.env'_** file accordingly. You will also have to manually edit the **_'public/js/main.js'_** file's **_'baseUrl'_** variable, sitting at the very top.
